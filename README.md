# GOVault: A Lightweight Go-Based JSON Database

GOVault is a minimalist yet powerful Go-based database system that uses JSON files for data persistence. It provides a straightforward interface for managing collections and records, making it ideal for small-scale projects or applications requiring lightweight data storage solutions. 

---

## Features üöÄ
- **RESTful API Interface**: Perform CRUD operations via HTTP.
- **JSON Storage**: Data is stored in JSON format for simplicity and readability.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Ensures data integrity using collection-specific mutexes.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns through `drivers`, `routes`, and `main` modules.
- **Easy to Set Up**: No external dependencies, just Go and your code.

## Project Structure üìÅ

```
GOVault/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go             # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drivers/            # Database management logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ drivers.go
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/             # HTTP route definitions and handlers
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes.go
```

### Module Responsibilities
1. **`main.go`**: Initializes the app, sets up routes, and manages graceful shutdowns.
2. **`drivers/`**: Handles low-level database operations like reading, writing, and deleting data.
3. **`routes/`**: Defines RESTful API endpoints and links them to the database functions.
